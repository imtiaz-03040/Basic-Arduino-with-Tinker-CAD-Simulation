# Blinking Light using Arduino

This is the most basic and classic Arduino project—blinking an LED on and off at regular intervals. It’s often the first program written by beginners to get started with microcontrollers and embedded systems.
# 🔧 Required Components

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)

LED (any color)

220Ω resistor

Jumper wires
# 💡 How It Works

# ⚙️ Circuit Setup
The LED’s anode (+) connects to a digital pin (e.g., pin 13) on the Arduino through a 220Ω resistor.

The cathode (–) is connected to the GND of the Arduino.
# 🔁 Program Logic
The Arduino turns the LED ON by setting the pin HIGH.

After a short delay (e.g., 1000 ms), it turns the LED OFF by setting the pin LOW.

This cycle repeats continuously, creating a blinking effect.
